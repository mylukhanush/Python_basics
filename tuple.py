#Tuple
#tuple is same as list
# tuple is immutable
# once the order is created it displays in same order

# n=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,"Bunny")
# x=10,11,10,12,"Khanush"
# y=13,14,15
# z=16,17

#trying to enter the value 500 into the second..
#..index of tuple it prints error as tuple is immutable
# y[2]=100
# print(y)

#multiplying tuple
# print(y*3)

# it will displaces the count of 10 in tuple
# print(x.count(10))

# displays the index value of the element
# print(x.index(10))

# slicing operations on tuple
# print(x[0:2])

# it is used to find length of the variable
# print(len(x))

# we can use all the functions
# like len,count,min,max ...etc which dont modify the tuple
